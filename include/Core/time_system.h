/*
    @file time_system.h
*   This file contains the time system struct and its functions.
?   The time system struct is used to keep track of the program's time, delta time, and time scale.
?   Time delta is the time between the current frame and the previous frame.
?   It's super useful for making sure that the game runs at the same speed on different fps.
